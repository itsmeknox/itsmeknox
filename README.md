## ðŸ‘£ My Journey

I started coding in **11th standard** â€” not from a science background, but from **commerce**. While most people were preparing for B.Tech and engineering paths, I made a conscious choice to take a different route.

Science never really interested me, but I was drawn to **creating and building**. Choosing commerce gave me something I value deeply: **time**. Time to learn how real systems are built, how production works, and how tools connect at scale.

Instead of following a traditional academic route, I taught myself how to work with real tools, build end-to-end systems, and deploy projects from scratch. While others followed tutorials, I was writing my own architecture.

After finishing school, I chose **BCA**, not because I had to, but because I was already building. For the last 2+ years, Iâ€™ve been creating backend systems, managing deployments, writing internal APIs, and self-hosting full stacks on my own servers.

I donâ€™t aim to be just a developer. Iâ€™m building toward becoming someone who can design, scale, and operate real-world systems.
